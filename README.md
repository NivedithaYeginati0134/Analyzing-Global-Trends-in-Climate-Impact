# Analyzing-Global-Trends-in-Climate-Impact

This project, "Global Trends in Climate Impact," utilizes Tableau for sophisticated data visualizations to analyze trends in energy production, environmental consequences, and public health outcomes. Key insights are drawn from multiple datasets, including changes in global temperatures, sea levels, CO2 emissions, and the shift from non-renewable to renewable energy sources.

## Key Technologies Highlighted:

- **Tableau**: Used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations that illustrate complex relationships and trends across the data. Visualizations include climate change impact analyses, CO2 emissions maps, and correlations between energy production and public health outcomes.
- **SQL**: Employed for data manipulation and querying to prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Statistics**: Fundamental in analyzing data trends and making predictive insights based on historical data patterns.
